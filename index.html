        <h2> Social Media in today's World</h2>
        <p>Social media has become an integral part of our lives, with millions of people using platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to connect with friends, share information, and express themselves. However, the rise of social media has also brought unethical issues with it such as an increase in cyberbullying, as well as a breeding ground for fake news.
        </p>
        <p>Cyberbullying is a form of bullying that takes place online. Cyberbullying can have serious consequences, including depression, anxiety, and even suicide. Victims of cyberbullying may feel isolated and unsupported, as the bullying can occur anonymously, making it difficult to identify the perpetrator. Unlike face-to-face interactions, online interactions are often anonymous, which can embolden bullies to act more aggressively. Social media also provides bullies with an audience, which can make them feel more powerful. Moreover, the constant availability of social media means that there is no escape from the bullying.Cyberbullying can also have a lasting impact, with victims often experiencing long-term psychological effects. </p>
        <p>d</p>
        <p>cyberbullying is a violation of basic ethical principles. Cyberbullying is a form of harassment, which is a violation of an individual’s right to be treated with respect and dignity. Cyberbullying is also a violation of the principle of non-maleficence, which requires individuals to avoid harming others.</p>

                <p>Nearly half of US teens have been bullied or harassed online</p>
            </header>
            <ul>
                <li>Some 49% of 15- to 17-year-olds have experienced at least one of the six online behaviors, compared with 42% of those ages 13 to 14. Older teens are more likely than their younger counterparts (22% vs. 11%) to say someone has sent them explicit images they didn’t ask for, an act sometimes referred to as cyberflashing; had someone share explicit images of them without their consent, in what is also known as revenge porn (8% vs. 4%); or been the target of persistent questioning about their whereabouts and activities (17% vs. 12%).</li>
                <li>A teen’s racial or ethnic background relates to whether they report having been targeted for cyberbullying because of race or ethnicity. Some 21% of Black teens report being made a target because of their race or ethnicity, compared with 11% of Hispanic teens and an even smaller share of White teens (4%).</li>

                <p>Fourteen-year-old Adriana Kuch of Bayville, N.J., was found dead at home on Feb. 3, days after she was attacked in the hallway of her high school.</p>
            </header>
            <ul>
               <li>The attack was recorded and later uploaded to TikTok, prompting a slew of nasty comments toward the teenager.Four students have been charged with assault or harassment in the assault, according to prosecutors. The superintendent of the school district has since resigned.</li>
                <li>Another 14-year-old, in a lawsuit against the district, alleges that she was assaulted by a group of teens in October and that the school took no action. Both incidents were recorded and uploaded online, allowing still more teens to pile on, exacerbating an already humiliating situation. </li>
                <li> A study from the University of Georgia suggests that increased social media usage directly correlates with cyberbullying, because young people are searching for the immediate rush, or dopamine hit, that comes from digital engagement.</li>

                <p>Kendra Gayle Licari, from Michigan, abused her daughter online using juvenile slang to keep herself from being identified.</p>
            </header>
            <ul>
                <li>She was arrested last month after a year-long investigation, to which FBI experts were called in to help search for the bully. Even though Licari used a VPN (virtual private network) to disguise the source of the messages and spiced up her messages with juvenile slang to make them look like they were written by a boy or girl, detectives were eventually able to connect the messages to Licari.</li>
                <li>After the victim turned to her mother for help, she allegedly reported the bullying to authorities. However, after computer experts from the FBI identified that the messages came from Licari's phone, she broke down under investigation and confessed to the bullying spree against her daughter.</li>
                <li>Licari was arraigned on Monday, December 12 - and released on $5,000 bail.</li>
